# Warhammer-Sim
This is a personal prototype of a warhammer statistics simulation. In the vein of Deadliest Warriors, my goal is to simmulate a Warhammer attach scenario and determine the odds to simply wound the target, reduce the target to half wounds and destroy the target by simulating the dice rolls n times to collect averages
